Money pooling 


In this digital era we have lot many area's already explored and inturn implemented but enhancements are always possible and with the latest demonetization E-wllets came in handy
But as modifications are still in play out team have come up with the idea of money pooling for family circle.the idealogy is we can create a common wallet pool for the family circle or apartment personnel where the money can pooled inside one common auto predictive wallet where expenses can be checked and monitored regularly giving us the predictive data of the monthly expenditure of the personnel in turn showing us impacted goods round the year that is on what month the purchases are focussed over what goods .This pooling wallet can be used by housing societeies where the common monthly maintainance can be collected from this wallet if someone fails to pay the bills of the society on time due to insufficient cash flow .This wallet hence can be linked to credit cards thus no checques are required no bank transfers are required all will be in the form of digital money and since all the bills these days can extensively paid using the E-wallets ,so can be done for the whole society collectively thus digitizing the whole living commodity .The technology focussed by our idea is mainly over data mining theme thus we are inclined to use python for data mining and predictive graphs and UI to be provided using a responsive web app by interacting ReactJS for front end and Python for back end.
